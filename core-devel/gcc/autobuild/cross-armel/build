#
# Shadow build is necessary for a successful GCC build (at least for 4.9.2).
#

mkdir -p build
cd build

#
# The following configuration:
#
# 1. Enables support for C, C++, "LTO";
#    a. Mind here, Object C/C++ support is not enabled, we will provide that
#       in the "llvm" package as they provide a higher quality support for them;
#    b. Fortran is needed for many mathematical packages, as well as some audio/
#       video codecs, remove support for fortran if you know what you are doing;
#	FIXME: Fortran support fails to build!!!
#    c. "LTO" is not really a language, but it enables GCC to use LTO flags, and
#       thus provide respective optimizations later;
# 2. Enables shared libraries for linking (this is probably a good choice to
#                                          reduce binary sizes of any packages
#                                          that links to GCC runtime libraries);
# 3. Enables POSIX style threading;
# 4. Enables linking to system Zlib;
# 5. Disables libunwind support for exception detection;
# 6. Enables GNU style C locales (you probably would not want to change this);
# 7. Disables pre-compiled headers for libstdcxx;
# 8. Disables libssp linking (not needed);
# 9. Enables GNU unique object;
# 10. Enables linker build ID;
# 11. Enables LTO support (as mentioned in note 1, section c);
# 12. Enables isl as the default cloog backend, and disables version check
#     for cloog (which is included in GCC itself, Cloog enables support for
#                graphite based optimizations);
# 13. Enables plugin support;
# 14. Enables libiberty installation (you may disable "--enable-install-libiberty"
#                                     if you really feel the urge...);
# 15. Enables GNU style linker hash;
# 16. Disables multilib support (you may remove "--disable-multilib" to enable
#                                the support for it, however you will need a copy of
#                                GCC with multilib support to build);
#     a. AOSC OS uses subsystems to provide binary support for foreign architectures.
# 17. Enable release level checking;
# 18. Defaults CXX ABI to C++98 (this is generally a compatibility measure, you may
#                                not change this option, which WILL result in binary
#                                incompatibility with AOSC OS);
#
# ARM specific configuration:
#
# ARMv7-a architecture, hard float point ABI, and tuned for Neon FPUs.
