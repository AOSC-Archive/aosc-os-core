# The following configuration:
#
# 1. Declares that libraries should be installed into /usr/lib instead of /lib64;
# 2. Declares bug tracking URL (should not be changed unless you are building a derivative);
# 3. Enables add-on support;
# 4. Disables obsolete RPC (Remote Procedural Call) support  
#    (--disable-obsolete-rpc to disable such support, if you know what you are doing);
# 5. Declares that Kernel verion 2.6.32 is the minimum accepted
#    (you may raise the version number as you like);
# 6. Enables "bind now" (dynamic loader) support;
# 7. Disables profiling support 
#    (you may enable, using --enable-profile to your need, however this is not realistic in
#    a "Core" environment);
# 8. Enables stackguard randomization for extra security;
# 9. Enables lock elision (essential for GUILE, and many others that is lock-sensitive);
# 10. Enables multiple architecture support 
#     (mainly used to distinguish among different builds, multiarch is not supported);
# 11. Disables "warning as error";
# 12. Ensure that static libraries are installed for development purposes;
