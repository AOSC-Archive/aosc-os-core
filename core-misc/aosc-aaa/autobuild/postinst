#Welcome to AOSC OS (with the brand new Core 3.1.0)!
#
#Here, let me introduce you to many of the changes that is introduced in this
#new release:
#
#	1. GCC compiler and runtime libraries are now updated to 5.2.0,
#	   please don't panic! GCC 5.2.0 is built with a default cxxabi
#	   of c++98, meaning that you wouldn't have to rebuild any of
#	   C++ programs that rely on GCC runtime (and of course, if you
#	   do have any proprietary/closed-source C++ program, they will
#	   still work after this update).
#	2. Well, and now you will start to see this message at every
#	   AOSC OS Core version update.
