Welcome to AOSC OS (with the brand new Core 3.1.0)!

Here, let me introduce you to many of the changes that is introduced in this
new release:

	1. GCC compiler and runtime libraries are now updated to 5.2.0,
	   please don't panic! GCC 5.2.0 is built with a default cxxabi
	   of c++98, meaning that you wouldn't have to rebuild any of
	   C++ programs that rely on GCC runtime (and of course, if you
	   do have any proprietary/closed-source C++ program, they will
	   still work after this update).
	2. Well, and now you will start to see this message at every
	   AOSC OS Core version update.

Thanks for using AOSC OS, and best regards,
Developers of AOSC OS
