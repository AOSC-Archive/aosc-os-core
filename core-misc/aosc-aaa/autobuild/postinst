Welcome to AOSC OS (5.0.0)!

This is a new series of AOSC OS Core with major updates and fixes over the old
Core 4 series.

Updates:

- Updated GNU C Library to 2.26.
- Updated GNU Binutils to 2.29.
- Updated GNU MPFR Library to 3.1.3.
- Updated Interger Set Library to 0.18.
- Updated GNU Compiler Compilation (GCC) to 7.2.0.
- Updated GNU DBM to 1.13.
- Updated Berkeley DB to 6.2.32.
- Updated Perl to 5.24.3.

Changes:

- Moved GCC specs from `autobuild3` to `gcc`, avoids potential build failures
  with software that records build-time compiler flags - when Autobuild3 is
  not installed.
- Moved Timezone Data out of Core tree, to allow for more timely updates.

What to Expect:

- A smooth update with little incompatibility, though it could happen.
- Minor performance gain from GNU C Library and GCC Runtime enhancements.

#
# <device>: the block device to be mounted.
# <mntpnt>: mount point, the mounting destination of the block device.
# <fstyte>: file system type, e.g. ext4, btrfs, etc.
# <options>: extra options to be passed to the file system driver.
# <dump>: whether the dump utility should dump and backup this particular
#         device/filesystem. Takes one of the following numeric values:
#         0 - ignore this device/filesystem;
#         1 - make a backup for this device/filesystem;
# <pass>: in what order fsck should do a file system check on this particular
#         device/filesystem. Takes one of the following numeric values:
#         0 - ignore this device/filesystem (btrfs should use 0);
#         1/2 - given a file system check is necessary, the order in which
#               the checks should proceed.
